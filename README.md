_The Driver:
The Driver is the person who actively writes the code. They are responsible for typing and focusing on the tactical aspects of coding, such as syntax, algorithm implementation, and ensuring the code compiles and runs_

_The Navigator:
The Navigator, on the other hand, takes a more strategic role. They review the code as itâ€™s being written, think about the broader implications, consider potential pitfalls, and suggest improvements or alternative approaches. The Navigator also ensures that the code adheres to best practices and overall design patterns. They might also look ahead to anticipate future tasks or potential challenges._
